Asgard is an immersive survival game where players navigate a post-apocalyptic crypto world where blockchain networks have become isolated islands of civilization. In this treacherous landscape, only the smartest traders and bridge masters can survive and thrive.

Players must master cross-chain asset bridging between Ethereum and Stellar networks, execute strategic DeFi trades, and compete with thousands of other survivors in a race for resources and dominance. The game combines skill-based trading challenges, interactive city exploration, and competitive survival mechanics, all powered by real blockchain technology including Hash Time Locked Contracts (HTLCs) and 1inch protocol integration.

As survivors progress through levels, they unlock advanced trading strategies, build their portfolio across multiple chains, and compete for the ultimate prize in this ultimate DeFi survival challenge.

- **Stellar SDK integration** for native network operations
- **Cross-chain transaction tracking** between Ethereum and Stellar

### Cross-Chain Bridge (Ethereum â†” Stellar)

## Cross-Chain Bridge Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant B as Backend
    participant E as Ethereum HTLC
    participant S as Stellar HTLC

    U->>F: Initiate Bridge
    F->>B: Request Bridge Quote
    B->>F: Return Quote
    F->>B: Execute Bridge
    B->>E: Create HTLC (Lock ETH)
    E->>B: HTLC Created
    B->>S: Create HTLC (Lock XLM)
    S->>B: HTLC Created
    B->>F: Bridge Status Update
    F->>U: Bridge Complete
```

## Bridge Security Model

The cross-chain bridge implements a trustless security model using HTLCs:

1. **Commit Phase**: Funds are locked on both chains with cryptographic hashes
2. **Reveal Phase**: Preimage revelation unlocks funds on destination chain
3. **Refund Phase**: Automatic refund if timelock expires without completion

**Security Guarantees:**

- No trusted intermediaries required
- Atomic execution (all-or-nothing)
- Cryptographic verification of transfers
- Time-bound operations with automatic refunds

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

**Multi-Chain Support**: The platform will expand beyond Ethereum and Stellar to include major blockchain networks such as Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche. This expansion will enable users to bridge assets across a wider ecosystem of blockchains, providing greater flexibility and access to diverse DeFi protocols and liquidity pools.

**Advanced DeFi Strategies**: Future iterations will implement sophisticated DeFi strategies including yield farming, liquidity provision, and automated portfolio rebalancing. These features will leverage the existing 1inch integration to optimize yield generation while maintaining the security and trustless nature of the platform.

**Cross-Chain NFT Bridging**: A significant enhancement will be the ability to bridge non-fungible tokens (NFTs) across different blockchain networks. This will involve implementing specialized smart contracts that can handle the unique properties of NFTs while maintaining their metadata and ownership information during cross-chain transfers.

### Technical Improvements

**Layer 2 Scaling Solutions**: Integration with Layer 2 scaling solutions such as Optimistic Rollups and ZK-Rollups will significantly reduce gas costs and improve transaction throughput. This will involve deploying smart contracts on Layer 2 networks and implementing cross-layer communication protocols.

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Implementation of zero-knowledge proofs will enhance privacy and security by allowing users to prove transaction validity without revealing sensitive information. This will be particularly valuable for cross-chain transfers involving private or sensitive data.
